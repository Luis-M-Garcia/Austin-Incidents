# Austin-Incidents
Data comes from data.gov 'EMS - Incidents by Month' published by data.austintexas.gov  
I checked how total incidents have trended over the years  
It seems that summers have the highest amount of incidents over the years while winters have the least
Incidents had steadily been going up since 2010  
There also seems to be some dip incidents around 2016-2019 but then it picked up again and remains going up
